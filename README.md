This console-based Java game pits a user against a random computer opponent. It leverages the built-in java.util.Scanner class to get user input from the command line and the Random class to generate the computer's choice. The program uses simple if-else logic or a switch statement to compare choices, determine the round's winner, update scores, and loop for multiple rounds until the user decides to quit. This project is ideal for beginners to practice core Java concepts like loops, conditionals, and input/output handling.
